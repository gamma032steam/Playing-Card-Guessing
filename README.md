Card game for Declarative Programming, Semester 2 2019 @ UniMelb

The key file is Proj1.hs.

This program plays a card guessing game. One player knows about n cards and provides feedback (suits correct, number of cards less than lowest rank of the guess, ect) to a guesser. This program generates all possible answers, makes the guess that will remove the most possiblilities, then discards answers that contradict the feedback.
